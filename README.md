# 🛡️ Fraud Detection Project Using Machine Learning

This repository implements a **Machine Learning-based system** to detect fraudulent transactions. Financial fraud is a critical challenge in digital finance, and this project uses data analysis and ML modeling to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s data-driven world, detecting fraud in financial data is essential for businesses and consumers alike. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can identify potential fraudulent activity based on past transactional patterns.

Major tasks included:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction of new transactions

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains features used to describe each transaction and the target label to indicate fraud or not.  
*Typical features might include transaction amount, timestamps, and categorical indicators (depending on the dataset you used).*

> ⚠️ **Note:** Add your dataset source link here (e.g., Kaggle or UCI) if applicable.

## 📥 Installation

### 1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/Thatha-Madhavi/Fraud-Detection-Project.git
cd Fraud-Detection-Project

### 2. Install dependencies

If you have a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If not, install manually:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## ▶️ How to Run
### Using the Notebook

Open and run the notebook for step-by-step exploration:

jupyter notebook analysis_model.ipynb

### Using the Prediction Script
python fraud_detection.py

## 📊 Model Evaluation

### Model performance is typically evaluated on:

- Accuracy

- Precision

- Recall

- F1-Score

- Confusion Matrix

These help understand how well the model detects both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
